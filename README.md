* `Spring Boot` Web Server with `JWT + Redis` authentication
* `FastAPI` RAG backend for AI persona response generation
* `MySQL (Cloud SQL)` as primary DB
* `GCP Storage` for image, letter, and event assets
* `LangChain + Vertex AI + Pinecone` for RAG pipeline
* `Flutter` mobile app client
* `Docker` deployment on GCP VM (Compute Engine)

### üß≠ Client Layer
- **Flutter**: Cross-platform mobile application framework.
- **Google Maps API**: Enables location-based features.
- **Google Design**: Ensures UI/UX consistency across devices.

The client communicates with the backend using RESTful APIs and receives both structured content and AI-generated responses.


### üîê Firebase Platform
- **Firebase Authentication**: Handles secure user login and identity verification.
- **Cloud Storage for Firebase**: Stores user-uploaded content such as images or letters.

Firebase communicates directly with both the client and server for authentication and media access.


### ‚öôÔ∏è Server Layer (GCP Compute Engine)
- **Spring Boot**: Java-based backend that manages user data, historical content, and API endpoints.
- **FastAPI**: Python-based service for handling AI interactions.
- **Docker**: Containerization of backend services for portability and scalability.


### üß† AI Integration
- **LangChain**: Orchestrates communication with the AI model.
- **Vertex AI + Gemini**: Google‚Äôs powerful LLM platform for generating historical personas and contextual responses.


### üóÑÔ∏è Database
- **Cloud SQL (MySQL)**: Stores all persistent data including users, locations, events, and AI-generated content.


## üîÅ Communication Flow

- The **Flutter client** sends user requests to the **Spring Boot** backend.
- If AI content is needed, Spring Boot relays the request to **FastAPI**, which processes it via **LangChain** & **RAG** and **Vertex AI (Gemini)**.
- **Firebase Authentication** verifies users, and **Cloud Storage** manages uploaded files.
- **Cloud SQL** stores and retrieves all application data.
